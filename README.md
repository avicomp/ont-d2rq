# ONT-D2RQ â€“ A Database to RDF Mapper
# This is a fork of D2RQ (https://github.com/d2rq/d2rq.git) adapted to our purposes.

There are following major differences with the original:

* Up-to-date dependencies (java 1.8, jena 3.x, etc)
* Supporting OWL2 DL syntax
* Compatibility with ONT-API (OWL-API over Jena)
* No more D2R Server
